        <h1>Getting Ready and Week 1 (Sept. 16th)</h1>
            <p>I am excited to share with you my journey through <a href="https://www.tech-moms.org/">Tech-Moms</a>. The goal is to show how a webpage can improve as you gain more knowledge.</p>

            <div>
                <p>In preparation of week one of class I was reviewing the preassignments in Degreed. As I was going through those videos and articles I came across Codecademy. I found that they had a free beginners course to HTML so I decided to give it a try. I completed that course and then moved onto beginnning CSS. I was unable to complete the CSS class but it gave me a great foundation to start week one with Tech-Moms.

                    <ul>During class today we added some extensions to our Visual Studios Code program.

                    <p>This was super helpful to make our VS Code look like Julie's so we could follow along easier. Some of the functionality that these extenions add made me so happy. I love the abilty to start typing a tag name and hitting tab to add the brackets and the closing tag. Seriously made my entire day. I also learned that once you have saved your file as a .html you can use ! tab to have it auto populate the meta data to start your webpage. </p>

                    <p>Once we were all on the same page with our tools and able to work together we worked to make the following during class. With out the CSS it is not the prettiest. Once we add the CSS it will look a quite a bit better.</p>

            <p>Today we go to hear from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linda-r-b492b5156/">Linda Robledo </a>who is a Technical Writer. She had us edit a document using <a href="https://hemingwayapp.com/">Hemmingwayapp.com</a> which gives you a grade level for your writting. It was fun to see how changing just a few words or sentences helps upgrade your writting. It was fun to hear her story and know that even though you start with one job you may end up in a completly different role that you love even more.</p>

        <div class="week3">
            <p>This was one of my favorite homework assignments. It comes from VSchool Bootcamp Primer 3. It was an optional excercise and it was really fun to troubleshoot and work on. I learned that for me it was easiest to take it one step at a time. In testing I used some funky colors to help me see what was happening with borders and such. I can tell you that this is probably the 3rd or 4th iteration of code but I am very proud that I worked through and made it happen.</p>

She is the director of Customer Feedback & Voice of the Customer (VOC). She has worked in tech for many years. My biggest take away from her was that you need to network. Also make sure you are working and growing in ways to progress into the job that you want next. When opportunities are given to you take them. We as women tend to not take a job because we feel underqualified for the job. It is okay to reach out for those jobs that you are mostly qualified for, most employers are more than happy to help train you in the areas that you feel deficient. </p>

            <p>Today we heard from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tara-shipp/">Tara Shipp</a> a UX/UI Designer. One of the first things that Tara shared with us is that Good UX is useful, usable, and delightful. I have a very difficult time making things pretty and useful. I  don't like design I would much rather test the product and give feedback. Tara shared a little test with us about logging into a program and it not allowing you to enter because your username or password is incorrect. This can be frustrating becuase you don't know which was incorrect. UX can help the end user know which is incorrect thus making it less frustrating. It was fun to try to troubleshoot how you would solve the problem and hear others input on how to solve the problem.</p>
