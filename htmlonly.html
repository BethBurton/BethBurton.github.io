        <h2>My Experience with Tech-Moms</h2>
        <h3>Week 1</h3>
        <p>I am excited to share with you my journey through <a href="https://www.tech-moms.org/">Tech-Moms</a>. The goal is to show how a webpage can improve as you gain more knowledge. 
        </p> 
        <hr>
        <p>With week one approching I spent some time in codecademy taking some free courses in HTML and CSS. I ended up not completing the CSS course becuase I was just typing what they were telling me to do and not understanding what I was doing.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The first day of class I was feeling all sorts of emotions:
            <ul>
                <li>nervous</li>
                <li>excitement</li>
                <li>scared</li>
                <li>uncomfortable</li>
                <li>ready to learn</li>
            </ul>
            just to name a few.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>It was a fun day getting to know each other and hearing from:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakohler/">Julie Kohler</a>,</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsay-wolfgramm/">Lindsay Wolfgramm</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikelblake/">Mikel Blake</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-jane-evans/">Sarah Evans</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/merianne-gates-430429105/">Merianne Gates</a></li>
            </ul>
            Having lunch with the Tech-Moms in color group and getting to know some of them was also uplifting.</p>
            <hr>
        <p>After lunch was an afternoon full of starting using HTML and getting familiar with the new tools that we had downloaded and made accounts for. Overall a very exciting day of learning <b>about</b> eachother and learning <b>with</b> each other. We also planned our first group outing for getting to know our study buddies.</p>

        <h3>Week 2</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>During class today we added some extensions to our Visual Studio Code program. 
            <ul>
                <li>Auto Rename Tag</li>
                <li>indent-rainbow</li>
                <li>Prettier-Code formatter</li>
                <li>Live Server (some of us had this one already)</li>
            </ul>
        This was super helpful to make our VS Code looked like Julie's so we could follow along easier. Some of the functionality that these add made me so happy. I love the abilty to start typing a tag name and hitting tab to add the brackets and the closing tag. Seriously made my entire day. I also learned that once you have saved your file as .html you can use ! tab to have it auto populate some meta data to start your webpage. </p>
        <hr>
        <p>Once we were all on the same page with or tools and being able to work together we worked to make the following during class.</p>
